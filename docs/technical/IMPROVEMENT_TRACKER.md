## 📝 Notes for Future Agents

1. **Port Configuration**: This project uses port 3001 for development (not default 3000)
2. **Package Manager**: Uses PNPM with workspaces (optimal for Nx)
3. **Monorepo Structure**: Apps in /apps, packages in /packages/@messai
4. **Test Strategy**: ✅ COMPLETED - Now uses Vitest exclusively (Jest fully removed)
5. **Build System**: ✅ COMPLETED - All configuration issues resolved, build process working
6. **Module Resolution**: ✅ COMPLETED - All @/ imports properly configured and working
7. **Library System**: ✅ COMPLETED - 12 comprehensive library files created and functional
8. **Security Priority**: Environment variables and dependency updates are critical

## 🚨 Known Issues

1. **.env.local exposure**: Contains sensitive credentials, needs immediate attention
2. ~~**Mixed test setup**: Both Jest and Vitest configs present~~ ✅ **RESOLVED** (2025-07-13)
3. **Large components**: Some components >600 lines, need refactoring
4. **No state management**: Heavy prop drilling, needs global state solution
