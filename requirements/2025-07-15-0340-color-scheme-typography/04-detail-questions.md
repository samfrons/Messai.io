# Expert Detail Questions

## Q6: Should we keep Inter + Crimson Text or switch to a more scientific pairing like DM Sans + JetBrains Mono?
**Default if unknown:** Keep Inter + Crimson Text (already loaded and optimized, Crimson Text adds elegance for scientific content)

## Q7: Should the Navigation component use the dark Caladan theme to match the rest of the application?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (currently uses white background which breaks visual consistency with dark Caladan pages)

## Q8: Should we update the root layout body background to use Caladan colors instead of basic light/dark grays?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (body className currently uses basic `bg-white dark:bg-gray-900` instead of Caladan variables)

## Q9: Should pages without the navigation bar (like homepage) have a different layout treatment?
**Default if unknown:** No (maintain consistent Caladan theme across all pages regardless of navigation presence)

## Q10: Should we create additional Caladan utility classes for common typography patterns (headings, body text, captions)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (would standardize typography implementation across all pages and components)
