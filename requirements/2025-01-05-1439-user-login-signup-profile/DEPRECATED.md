# DEPRECATED REQUIREMENT

This requirement has been **superseded** by more recent design decisions.

## Superseded By
- **2025-07-15-0340-color-scheme-typography** - Caladan Bio aesthetic now the standard

## Reason for Deprecation
The LCARS theme removal approach specified in this requirement conflicts with the current Caladan Bio design system. The authentication improvements are still valid, but the styling approach should follow the Caladan Bio aesthetic.

## Valid Parts Still Applicable
- Enhanced authentication features
- Profile management improvements
- Administrative features
- Technical architecture patterns

## Deprecated Parts
- LCARS theme removal (superseded by Caladan Bio implementation)
- Generic Tailwind approach (superseded by Caladan design system)
- Standard UI patterns (superseded by Caladan aesthetic)

**Status**: DEPRECATED - Do not implement styling changes from this requirement
