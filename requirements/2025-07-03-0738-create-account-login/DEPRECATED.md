# DEPRECATED REQUIREMENT

This requirement has been **superseded** by more recent design decisions.

## Superseded By
- **2025-07-15-0340-color-scheme-typography** - Caladan Bio aesthetic now the standard

## Reason for Deprecation
The LCARS theme with orange/cyan accents conflicts with the current Caladan Bio design system (dark green aesthetic). The authentication functionality is still valid, but styling should follow the Caladan Bio approach.

## Valid Parts Still Applicable
- Authentication flow implementations
- Email verification system
- Password reset functionality
- Route protection patterns
- Technical architecture

## Deprecated Parts
- LCARS theme implementation (superseded by Caladan Bio)
- Orange/cyan accent colors (superseded by Caladan green)
- LCARS-specific styling patterns (superseded by Caladan aesthetic)

**Status**: DEPRECATED - Do not implement styling changes from this requirement
